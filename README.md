# Password Strength Test from rumkin.com

From the [site](http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php):

```
This password checker will gauge your password and give it a score based on how good of a password it is.
It will let you know if you picked a common password (don't do that!) and it will also take into account
the probability of letters landing close to each other.
```
